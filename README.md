### Background & Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Principal Findings
Upon thorough examination and synthesis of data from multiple industry sources, coupled with benchmarking against prevailing market trends, our analysis illuminated three primary determinants for successful movie production: genre preference, optimal release timing, and return on investment (ROI) considerations. Based on this rigorous analysis, we provide cogent recommendations regarding the genres that are most in vogue, the release windows that maximize box office intake, and the investment thresholds that yield the most favorable ROI.
